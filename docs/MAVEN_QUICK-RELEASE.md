## Method 2: Automatic Release on Push (Simplest)

Just push to your `release-x.y.z` branch - the workflow automatically deploys (or stages) the build!

```bash
# Already done! Your current push already triggered deployment
# Check: https://github.com/artagon/artagon-bom/actions
# Check: https://github.com/artagon/artagon-parent/actions
```

## Method 3: Release via Git Tag

### artagon-bom:
```bash
cd /Users/gtrump001c@cable.comcast.com/Projects/Artagon/artagon-bom
git tag bom-v1.0.0
git push origin bom-v1.0.0
```

### artagon-parent:
```bash
cd /Users/gtrump001c@cable.comcast.com/Projects/Artagon/artagon-parent
git tag v1
git push origin v1
```

âœ… `.github/workflows/examples/release-tag.yml` validates the tag against the Maven version and auto-deploys to GitHub Packages / Maven Central!
